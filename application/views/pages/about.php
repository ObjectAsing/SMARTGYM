					Gym is actually the shortened term for gymnasium. Gyms were very important spaces to ancient Greeks. They were where the Greeks practiced various sports such as boxing, self-defense, and took care of their overall physical fitness; engaged in physical therapy, and studied subjects as philosophy. The first gym in the United States of America (USA) was established in 1925 by a German doctor named Beck. Gymnasiums in public schools were also established in the 1920s.

Today’s gyms offer a variety of indoor activities, amenities, and events. And just like fitness centers, there are many sizes and types. Some gyms focus solely on weight training or lifting. In fact, that was your typical gym.

					Again just like fitness centers, gyms offer classes in various workout disciplines and sporting activities; provide experienced, certified (personal) trainers and staff; the use of treadmills, rowing machines, cycling stations, and other cardiovascular equipment, the use of free weights such as barbells, dumbbells, and weight machines, swimming pool, maybe saunas, steam rooms, basketball courts, tanning, locker rooms, showers, and childcare services. For your comfort and ease, the cardio equipment may have televisions, audio equipment or virtual reality devices attached to them.

					High-end gyms go all out providing the services of fitness centers, gyms, and health clubs combined and more. For instance, Equinox in New York City offers Kiehl’s beauty products in their locker rooms, facials, eyelash extensions, massages, and clothing boutiques. David Barton Gyms, also in New York City, have live DJs and sponsors special events such as block parties. 24 Hour Fitness, a National chain, even provides laundry service to its clients.

					Fitness centers usually occupy large spaces, but the space can also be medium or small. It all depends on the amenities and activities they offer. Some have indoor and outdoor sports facilities as swimming pools, running tracks, rock climbing, sports playing fields, racquetball courts, rooms for martial arts, yoga, Pilates, spinning, weight training as classes or for individual use, and regular gym equipment such as treadmills, elliptical and cycling machines.
